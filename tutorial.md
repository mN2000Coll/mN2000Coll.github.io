# MCP Tutorial

The following is our MCP tutorial. This tutorial will focus specifically on the "Github MCP Server", which can be integrated within Visual Studio Code, to allow AI assistants access to your Github depositories of choice. 

As a prerequisite, ensure you have a recent version of ***Visual Studio Code*** installed for optimal results.

## Step 1 - Settings
Firstly we should check our Visual Studio Code installation's settings, to ensure that access to MCP is enabled.

Within the settings, we want to make sure we're in the Chat tab and ensure that the Agent option is ticked as shown.

We can also search "chat.mcp" within the settings search bar to check if additional settings are enabled.
